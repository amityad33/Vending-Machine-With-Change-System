# Vending-Machine-With-Change-System
-Tools & technologies used: EDA Playground, Verilog.
-A vending machine is an automated machine that provides items to consumers after cash, or other form of payment is made.
-The modeling of the Finite State-based Vending Machine using the mealy model.
– The Vending Machine takes in two different coins of worth 5 and 10 respectively and in turn increases the state
accordingly.
– The machine dispenses out the item selected once its state is reached. It even gives out change if higher state is
achieved.
